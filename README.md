# calculator

### This is going to be a simple calculator having basic **add**, **subtract**, **multiply**, **divide** functions along with **remainder** and **expnent** functions.

> The first version of the calculator will only be able to do simple calculations (eg. 2+2 = 4, 3/4=0.75 etc) with only one operator at a time.
